Assignment No: 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Title of the Assignment: Data Wrangling, I 
Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv) 
Import all the required Python Libraries. 
1. Locate open source data from the web (e.g. https://www.kaggle.com). 
2. Provide a clear description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site). 
3. Load the Dataset into the pandas data frame. 
4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas insult(), describe() 
function to get some initial statistics. Provide variable descriptions. Types of variables 
etc. Check the dimensions of the data frame. 
5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking 
the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the 
data set. If variables are not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions. 
6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python. 
Introduction to Data Wrangling 
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy 
access and analysis. 
With the amount of data and data sources rapidly growing and expanding, it is getting 
increasingly essential for large amounts of available data to be organized for analysis. This 
process typically includes manually converting and mapping data from one raw form into 
another format to allow for more convenient consumption and organization of the data. 
The Goals of Data Wrangling 
Reveal a "deeper intelligence" by gathering data from multiple sources 
Provide accurate, actionable data in the hands of business analysts in a timely matter 
Reduce the time spent collecting and organizing unruly data before it can be utilized 
Enable data scientists and analysts to focus on the analysis of data, rather than the wrangling 
Drive better decision-making skills by senior leaders in an organization 
Key Steps to Data Wrangling 
Data Acquisition: Identify and obtain access to the data within your sources. 
Joining Data: Combine the edited data for further use and analysis. 
Data Cleansing: Redesign the data into a usable and functional format and correct/remove any 
bad data. 
Panda functions for Data Formatting and Normalization 
The Transforming data stage is about converting the data set into a format that can be analyzed 
or modelled effectively, and there are several techniques for this process. 
a. Data Formatting: Ensuring all data formats are correct (e.g. object, text,floating 
number, integer, etc.) is another part of this initial ‘cleaning’ process. If you are 
working with dates in Pandas, they also need to be stored in the exact format to use 
special date-time functions. 
b. Data normalization: Mapping all the nominal data values onto a uniform scale 
(e.g. from 0 to 1) is involved in data normalization. Making the ranges consistent 
across variables helps with statistical analysis and ensures better comparisons 
later on.. 
Algorithm: 
Step 1 : Import all the required Python Libraries. 
Step 2: Load the weather dataset from Kaggle in dataframe object df 
Step 3: Print dataset.    
df.head() 
df.tail() 
Step 4.1: Describe function returns the statistical summary of the data frame or series.      
df.describe() 
Step 4.2:  identify missing data A) convert the "?","blackspace" into NaN(non numerical data) 
function: replace() The replace () method replaces the specified value with another specified value. 
The replace() method searches the entire Data Frame and replaces every case of specified value. 
df.replace("  ", np.nan, inplace = True) 
df.head(9) 
Step 4.3: Check if missing value are present. 
missingdata=df.isnull() 
df.isnull().sum() 
Step 4.4: Deal with missing Data a. Drop data Functions:dropna() b. replace data calculate the 
mean() 
df.dropna() 
Step 4.5: Replace Data Calculate the mean and replace the null value by mean by using fillna() 
function  
mean_value = df['temperature'].mean() 
df['temperature'] = df['temperature'].fillna(mean_value) 
mean_v=df['windspeed'].mean() 
new_df = df.fillna({'temperature':0, 
'windspeed':0, 
'event':'no_event'})'event':'no_event'}) 
new_df 
Step 5: Summarize the types of variables by checking the data types 
df.dtypes 
df[["duration"]]=df[["duration"]].astype("float") 
df.head() 
Step 7: Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables  
df3 = df.copy() 
df3 = pd.get_dummies(df3, 
columns = ['event']) 
display(df3) 
Conclusion- In this way we have explored the functions of the python library for Data 
Preprocessing, Data Wrangling Techniques and How to Handle missing values. 

explain me concepts from basics present here in easy language
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Great! Let me explain all the concepts from your Assignment No. 1: Data Wrangling I in very simple language:

🔹 What is Data Wrangling?
Think of data wrangling as cleaning and organizing messy data so that we can use it easily for analysis or machine learning.

Imagine you get a messy Excel sheet from different people—your job is to clean, fix, and convert it into a nice, organized sheet.

🔹 Steps in Data Wrangling (Explained Step-by-Step)
✅ Step 1: Import Required Libraries
These are basic tools in Python to work with data:

import pandas as pd     # for data handling
import numpy as np      # for number handling
✅ Step 2: Load Dataset
You can get datasets from websites like Kaggle.
Then load it into a DataFrame:

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  # load CSV file into pandas
✅ Step 3: Display the Dataset
df.head()     # Shows first 5 rows
df.tail()     # Shows last 5 rows
This helps you take a quick look at the data.

✅ Step 4: Preprocessing the Data
📌 4.1: Summary of the Data
df.describe()
This gives a summary: mean, max, min, standard deviation for numeric columns.

📌 4.2: Handle Missing Values
Sometimes missing data is shown as " " or "?", which we need to convert to NaN (Not a Number):

df.replace("  ", np.nan, inplace=True)
📌 4.3: Check for Missing Data
df.isnull().sum()
This tells you how many values are missing in each column.

📌 4.4: Deal with Missing Data
You can either:

A. Remove rows with missing data:

df.dropna()
B. Fill missing data with average (mean):

mean_temp = df['temperature'].mean()
df['temperature'].fillna(mean_temp, inplace=True)
Or set default values:

df.fillna({
  'temperature': 0,
  'windspeed': 0,
  'event': 'no_event'
}, inplace=True)
✅ Step 5: Check and Fix Data Types
Each column can be:

object → text

int → whole numbers

float → decimal numbers

datetime → dates

Check types:

df.dtypes
Fix types:

df['duration'] = df['duration'].astype(float)
✅ Step 6: Convert Categorical to Numerical (One-Hot Encoding)
If you have text categories like 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Snow' in a column, convert them to numbers:

df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['event'])
This makes new columns like:

event_Rainy

event_Sunny

event_Snow

Each will be 0 or 1 depending on the row.

🧠 Final Goal:
At the end of all these steps, your data is:

Clean (no missing or wrong values)

Properly typed (correct data types)

Ready for analysis or machine learning.

📌 Conclusion (As in the assignment)
In this assignment, we learned how to clean data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. We explored how to identify and fix missing values, convert variable types, and turn text categories into numbers—this is the foundation of preparing data for analysis or modeling.

Would you like me to give you a sample code using a real dataset from Kaggle?

Title of the Assignment 2: Data Wrangling, II 
Create an “Academic performance” dataset of students and perform the following operations 
using Python. 
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values and/or 
inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them. 
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable techniques 
to deal with them. 
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this transformation 
should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better understanding of the 
variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to decrease the skewness and 
convert the distribution into a normal distribution. 
Reason and document your approach properly. 
Objective of the Assignment: Students should be able to perform thedata wrangling operation 
using Python on any open source dataset 
Prerequisite: 
1. Basic of Python Programming 
2. Concept of Data Preprocessing, Data Formatting , Data Normalization and Data Cleaning. 
Contents for Theory: 
1. Creation of Dataset using Microsoft Excel. 
2. Identification and Handling of Null Values 
3. Identification and Handling of Outliers 
4. Data Transformation for the purpose of : 
a. To change the scale for better understanding 
b. To decrease the skewness and convert distribution into normal distribution 
Theory: 
1. Creation of Dataset using Microsoft Excel. The dataset is created in “CSV” format. 
● The name of dataset is StudentsPerformance 
● The features of the dataset are: Math_Score, Reading_Score, Writing_Score, 
Placement_Score Club_Join_Date . 
● Number of Instances: 30 
● The response variable is: Placement_Offer_Count . 
● Range of Values: Math_Score [60-80], Reading_Score[75-,95], ,Writing_Score [60,80], 
Placement_Score[75-100], Club_Join_Date [2018-2021]. 
● The response variable is the number of placement offers facilitated to particular students, 
which is largely depend on Placement_Score To fill the values in the dataset the 
RANDBETWEEN is used. Returns a random integer number between the numbers you specify 
Syntax : RANDBETWEEN(bottom, top) Bottom The smallest integer and Top The largest 
integer RANDBETWEEN will return. 
For better understanding and visualization, 20% impurities are added into each variable to the 
dataset.Identification and Handling of Null Values Missing Data can occur when no information 
is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit. Missing Data is a very big problem in real
life scenarios. Missing Data can also refer to as NA (Not Available) values in pandas. In Data 
Frame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was 
not collected or it never existed. For Example, suppose different users being surveyed may 
choose not to share their income, some users may choose not to share the address in this way 
many datasets went missing.s 
2.Checking for missing values using notnull () 
In order to check null values in Pandas Dataframe, notnull () function is used. This function 
return dataframe of Boolean values which are False for NaN values. Deleting null values using 
dropna () method 
In order to drop null values from a dataframe, dropna () function is used. This function drops 
Rows/Columns of datasets with Null values in different ways. 
1. Dropping rows with at least 1 null value 
2. Dropping rows if all values in that row are missing 
3. Dropping columns with at least 1 null value. 
4. Dropping Rows with at least 1 null value in CSV file 
3. Identification and Handling of Outliers 
3.1 Identification of Outliers 
One of the most important steps as part of data preprocessing is detecting and treating the 
outliers as they can negatively affect the statistical analysis and the training process of a machine 
learning algorithm resulting in lower accuracy. 
What are Outliers? 
We all have heard of the idiom „odd one out' which means something unusual in comparison to 
the others in a group. Similarly, an Outlier is an observation in a given dataset that lies far from 
the rest of the observations. That means an outlier is vastly larger or smaller than the remaining 
values in the set. 
Why do they occur? 
An outlier may occur due to the variability in the data, or due to experimental error/human 
error.They may indicate an experimental error or heavy skewness in the data(heavy-tailed 
distribution). 
What do they affect? 
In statistics, we have three measures of central tendency namely Mean, Median,and Mode. They 
help us describe the data.Mean is the accurate measure to describe the data when we do not have 
anyoutliers present. Median is used if there is an outlier in the dataset. Mode is used if thereis an 
outlier AND about ½ or more of the data is the same.„Mean‟ is the only measure of central 
tendency that is affected by the outliers which in turn impacts Standard deviation. 
3.2 Detecting Outliers 
If our dataset is small, we can detect the outlier by just looking at the dataset. Butwhat if we 
have a huge dataset, how do we identify the outliers then? We need to use visualization and 
mathematical techniques.Below are some of the techniques of detecting outliers 
 Boxplots 
 Scatterplots 
 Z-score 
 Inter Quantile Range(IQR) 
3.2.1 Detecting outliers using Boxplot: 
It captures the summary of the data effectively and efficiently with only a simple box and 
whiskers. Boxplot summarizes sample data using 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. One can just 
get insights(quartiles, median, and outliers) into the dataset by just looking at its boxplot. 
3.2.2 Detecting outliers using Scatterplot: 
It is used when you have paired numerical data, or when your dependent variable has multiple 
values for each reading independent variable, or when trying to determine the relationship 
between the two variables. In the process of utilizing the scatter plot, one can also use it for 
outlier detection. 
To plot the scatter plot one requires two variables that are somehow related to each other. So here 
Placement score and Placement count features are used. 
3.2.3 Detecting outliers using Z-Score: 
Z-Score is also called a standard score. This value/score helps to understand how far is the data 
point     
from the mean. And after setting up a threshold value one can utilize z score values of data 
points to  
define the outliers. 
3.2.4 Detecting outliers using Inter Quantile Range(IQR): 
IQR (Inter Quartile Range) Inter Quartile Range approach to finding the outliers is the most 
commonly used and most trusted approach used in the research field. 
IQR = Quartile3 – Quartile1 
To define the outlier base value is defined above and below datasets normal range namely Upper 
and Lower bounds, define the upper and the lower bound (1.5*IQR value is considered) : 
upper = Q3 +1.5*IQR 
lower = Q1 – 1.5*IQR 
In the above formula as according to statistics, the 0.5 scale-up of IQR 
(new_IQR    
= IQR + 0.5*IQR) is taken. 
5. Handling of Outliers: 
For removing the outlier, one must follow the same process of removing an entry from the dataset 
using its exact position in the dataset because in all the above methods of detecting the outliers end 
result is the list of all those data items that satisfy the outlier definition according to the method 
used. 
Below are some of the methods of treating the outliers 
● Trimming/removing the outlier 
● Quantile based flooring and capping 
● Mean/Median imputation 
Conclusion: In this way we have explored the functions of the python library for Data 
Identifying and handling the outliers. Data Transformations Techniques are explored with the 
purpose of creating the new variable and reducing the skewness from datasets.

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's break down Assignment 2: Data Wrangling II into basic, easy-to-understand concepts. This task is about working with a dataset of students' academic performance, fixing problems in the data, and preparing it for further analysis.

🔹 Objective:
You are learning how to clean, organize, and prepare data (called data wrangling) using Python. This helps improve analysis and machine learning results.

🔸 Dataset Description:
The dataset is about students' academic performance.

File is created using Excel and saved as CSV.

It includes 30 students and the following features (columns):

Column Name	Description
Math_Score	Score between 60-80
Reading_Score	Score between 75-95
Writing_Score	Score between 60-80
Placement_Score	Score between 75-100
Club_Join_Date	Year of club joining (2018 to 2021)
Placement_Offer_Count	How many job offers the student received (response/output variable)
🔸 Step-by-Step Concepts
1️⃣ Handling Missing Values (Null values)
🟡 What are missing values?
When some data is not available or was not entered properly (like empty cells), they are called missing or null values.

🛠️ How to find them?
Use functions like:

data.isnull()           # Shows True/False where values are missing
data.isnull().sum()     # Tells how many values are missing in each column
🧹 How to clean them?

dropna(): Deletes rows/columns that have null values.

fillna(value): Fills missing values with a value like mean, median, or a fixed number.

2️⃣ Handling Outliers
🟡 What are outliers?
Values that are too different from the rest of the data.
Example: If most students score 70-80, but one scores 20, that 20 is an outlier.

📊 Why fix them?
Outliers can make the average (mean) and model results incorrect or biased.

🔍 How to detect outliers?
There are four common methods:

a) Boxplot
Visual method. If a point is outside the box (too high/low), it’s an outlier.

b) Scatter Plot
Shows the relationship between two numeric columns. Points far away from others = outliers.

c) Z-Score
Tells how far a data point is from the average in terms of standard deviation.

Z > 3 or Z < -3 → considered outlier

from scipy.stats import zscore
z_scores = zscore(data["column_name"])
d) IQR (Interquartile Range)
IQR = Q3 − Q1 (middle 50% of the data)

Outliers lie below: Q1 − 1.5*IQR
Or above: Q3 + 1.5*IQR

3️⃣ Data Transformation
🟡 What is it?
Changing data to make it easier to understand or analyze.

🛠️ Common transformations:

a) Scaling
Changing values to a smaller scale (like 0 to 1) — helps in visualizing and comparing scores.

b) Reducing Skewness
If data is not symmetric (skewed), applying log or square root helps make it look more normal.

c) Making relationships linear
Sometimes converting a variable helps in building a better model.

🧪 Example:

import numpy as np
data['Log_Placement_Score'] = np.log(data['Placement_Score'])
4️⃣ Why It’s Important
Clean data = better results.

Outliers and missing data = bad analysis.

Transforming data = better visualizations and predictions.

✅ Summary:
Task	Python Tool/Function
Check missing values	isnull(), sum(), dropna(), fillna()
Detect outliers	Boxplot, Z-score, IQR, Scatter plot
Remove/fix outliers	Drop rows or use capping
Transform data	np.log(), StandardScaler, etc.

Finding and fixing missing values,

Detecting and handling outliers,

Transforming data to improve analysis.

✅ Code Cell 2: Importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
🧠 Explanation:

numpy & pandas — for data handling and math operations.

matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn — for visualization.

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") — hides warning messages.

StandardScaler — used to standardize features (zero mean and unit variance).

✅ Code Cell 3: Load Dataset
data = pd.read_csv('../academic performance.csv')
data.head()
🧠 Explanation:

Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.

head() displays the first 5 rows.

✅ Code Cell 4: Check Data Info
data.info()
🧠 Explanation: Shows summary of the dataset:

Number of rows and columns

Column names and data types

How many non-null (non-missing) entries

✅ Code Cell 5: Check Missing Values
data.isnull().sum()
🧠 Explanation:

Checks each column for missing values (nulls).

Returns count of missing entries in each column.

✅ Code Cell 6: Commented Cleaning Technique
# we can remove null values by dropping rows or fill null values as per features
# data1 = data.interpolate()
🧠 Explanation:

Describes two options: drop rows or fill missing values (e.g., using interpolate() to estimate values between known points).

✅ Code Cell 7: Another way to check missing
# data1.isnull().sum()
🧠 Explanation: Would show if missing values remain in data1. (But this line is commented out.)

✅ Code Cell 8: Fill Missing Values with Mean
mean_val = data['raisedhands'].mean()
data['raisehands']=data['raisehands'].fillna(mean_val)
data2.isnull().sum()
🧠 Explanation:

Calculates the mean of the 'raisedhands' column.

Fills missing values in 'raisehands' with this mean.
❗ Note: 'raisehands' seems misspelled or inconsistent. Should probably be 'raisedhands'.

data2 is used here without being defined — might cause error.

✅ Code Cell 9: Alternative – Drop Rows
# data.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
🧠 Explanation: Removes all rows with missing values (but the line is commented out).

✅ Code Cell 10: Outlier Detection with Boxplot
fig,axis = plt.subplots(1, 2)
max_val = data2.VisITedResources.quantile(0.95)
min_val = data2.VisITedResources.quantile(0.05)
print("Before Shape", data.shape)
df = data2[(data2['VisITedResources'] > min_val) & (data2['VisITedResources'] < max_val)]
print("After Shape", df.shape)
sns.boxplot(data2['VisITedResources'], orient='v', ax=axis[0])
axis[0].title.set_text('Before')
sns.boxplot(df['VisITedResources'], orient='v', ax=axis[1])
axis[1].title.set_text('After')
plt.show()
🧠 Explanation:

Detects outliers using IQR percentiles (removes top 5% and bottom 5% values).

Compares data before and after removing outliers using boxplots.

Again, data2 is not defined — should probably be data.

✅ Code Cell 11: Comment – Data Transformation
#   3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables...
🧠 Explanation: Just an instruction reminder.

✅ Code Cell 12: Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
x = df[['raisedhands', 'VisITedResources', 'AnnouncementsView', 'Discussion']]
scaledf = scaler.fit_transform(x)
print(scaledf)
🧠 Explanation:

Title of the Assignment:  
Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and variability  
Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)  
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for a  
dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative  
(categorical) variables. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and  
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the 
age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical  
variable.  
2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,  
standard deviation etc. of the species of „Iris-setosa‟, „Iris-versicolor‟ and „Iris- versicolor‟ of  
iris.csv dataset. 
Provide the codes with outputs and explain everything that you do in this step. 
Objective of the Assignment: Students should be able to perform the Statistical operations 
using Python on any open source dataset. 
Prerequisite:  
1. Basic of Python Programming  
2. Concept of statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation etc. 
1. Summary statistics:  
● What is Statistics?  
Statistics is the science of collecting data and analysing them to infer proportions (sample) 
that are representative of the population. In other words, statistics is interpreting data in order 
to make predictions for the population.  
Branches of Statistics: There are two branches of Statistics.  
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS : Descriptive Statistics is a statistics or a measure that 
describes the data.  
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS : Using a random sample of data taken from a population to 
describe and make inferences about the population is called Inferential Statistics.  
Descriptive Statistics : 
Descriptive Statistics is summarising the data at hand through certain numbers like mean, 
median etc. so as to make the understanding of the data easier. It does not involve any 
generalisation or inference beyond what is available. This means that the descriptive statistics 
are just the representation of the data (sample) available and not based on any theory of 
probability. 
Commonly Used Measures  
1. Measures of Central Tendency  
2. Measures of Dispersion (or Variability)  
● Measures of Central Tendency  
A Measure of Central Tendency is a one number summary of the data that typically describes 
the centre of the data.  
This one number summary is of three types.  
a. Mean :  
Mean is defined as the ratio of the sum of all the observations in the data to the total 
number of observations. This is also known as Average. Thus mean is a number 
around which the entire data set is spread. Consider the following data points. 17, 16, 
21, 18, 15, 17, 21, 19, 11, 23 
b. Median :  
Median is the point which divides the entire data into two equal halves. One-half of the 
data is less than the median, and the other half is greater than the same. Median is 
calculated by first arranging the data in either ascending or descending order. ○ If the 
number of observations is odd, the median is given by the middle observation in the 
sorted form. ○ If the number of observations are even, median is given by the mean of the 
two middle observations in the sorted form. An important point to note is that the order of 
the data (ascending or descending) does not affect the median. 
To calculate Median, let's arrange the data in ascending order. 11, 15, 16, 17, 17, 18, 19, 
21, 21, 23 
Since the number of observations is even (10), median is given by the average of the two 
middle observations (5th and 6th here). 
c. Mode :  
Mode is the number which has the maximum frequency in the entire data set, or in 
other words,mode is the number that appears the maximum number of times. A data 
can have one or more than one mode.  
●  If there is only one number that appears the maximum number of times, the data has 
one mode, and is called Uni-modal.  
●  If there are two numbers that appear the maximum number of times, the data has two 
modes, and is called Bi-modal.  
●  If there are more than two numbers that appear the maximum number of times, the 
data has more than two modes, and is called Multi-modal.  
Consider the following data points. 17, 16, 21, 18, 15, 17, 21, 19, 11, 23  
Mode is given by the number that occurs the maximum number of times. Here, 17 and 
21 both occur twice. Hence, this is a Bimodal data and the modes are 17 and 21. 
● Measures of Dispersion (or Variability)  
Measures of Dispersion describes the spread of the data around the central value (or the 
Measures of Central Tendency) 
1. Absolute Deviation from Mean — The Absolute Deviation from Mean, also called 
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), describes the variation in the data set, in the sense 
that it tells the average absolute distance of each data point in the set. It is calculated 
as 
2. Variance — Variance measures how far are data points spread out from the mean. A 
high variance indicates that data points are spread widely and a small variance 
indicates that the data points are closer to the mean of the data set. It is calculated as 
3. Standard Deviation — The square root of Variance is called the Standard Deviation. It 
is calculated as 
4. Range — Range is the difference between the Maximum value and the Minimum 
value in the data set. It is given as 
5.  Quartiles — Quartiles are the points in the data set that divides the data set into four 
equal parts. Q1, Q2 and Q3 are the first, second and third quartile of the data set.  
● 25% of the data points lie below Q1 and 75% lie above it.  
● 50% of the data points lie below Q2 and 50% lie above it. Q2 is nothing but    
Median.  
● 75% of the data points lie below Q3 and 25% lie above it. 
6.Skewness — The measure of asymmetry in a probability distribution is defined by 
Skewness. It can either be positive, negative or undefined. 
Positive Skew — This is the case when the tail on the right side of the curve is bigger 
than that on the left side. For these distributions, mean is greater than the mode.  
Negative Skew — This is the case when the tail on the left side of the curve is bigger 
than that on the right side. For these distributions, mean is smaller than the mode. The 
most commonly used method of calculating Skewness is If the skewness is zero, the 
distribution is symmetrical. If it is negative, the distribution is Negatively Skewed and 
if it is positive, it is Positively Skewed.

2. Types of Variables:  
A variable is a characteristic that can be measured and that can assume different 
values. Height, age, income, province or country of birth, grades obtained at school 
and type of housing are all examples of variables. 
Variables may be classified into two main categories:  
● Categorical and  
● Numeric.  
Each category is then classified in two subcategories: nominal or ordinal for 
categorical variables, discrete or continuous for numeric variables. 
Categorical variables: 
A categorical variable (also called qualitative variable) refers to a characteristic that 
can‟t be quantifiable.  
Categorical variables can be either nominal or ordinal.  
○ Nominal Variable A nominal variable is one that describes a name, label or 
category without natural order. In the given table, the variable “mode of 
transportation for travel to work” is also nominal. 
o Ordinal Variable An ordinal variable is a variable whose values are defined by an 
order relation between the different categories. In the following table, the variable 
“behaviour” is ordinal because the category “Excellent” is better than the category 
“Very good,” which is better than the category “Good,” etc. There is some natural 
ordering, but it is limited since we do not know by how much “Excellent” behaviour 
is better than “Very good” behaviour. 
Numerical Variables : 
A numeric variable (also called quantitative variable) is a quantifiable characteristic 
whose values are numbers (except numbers which are codes standing up for 
categories). Numeric variables may be either continuous or discrete.  
○ Continuous variables 
A variable is said to be continuous if it can assume an infinite number of real values 
within a given interval. For instance, consider the height of a student. The height can‟t 
take any values. It can‟t be negative and it can‟t be higher than three metres. But 
between 0 and 3, the number of possible values is theoretically infinite. A student may 
be 1.6321748755 … metres tall.  
○ Discrete variables  
As opposed to a continuous variable, a discrete variable can assume only a finite 
number of real values within a given interval. An example of a discrete variable 
would be the score given by a judge to a gymnast in competition: the range is 0 to 10 
and the score is always given to one decimal (e.g. a score of 8.5) 
3. Summary statistics of income grouped by the age groups  
Problem Statement: For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and 
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by 
the age groups. 
Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical 
variable. Categorical Variable: Genre Quantitative Variable :  
Age  
Syntax: df.groupby(['Genre'])['Age'].mean()

Sure! Let's break down the entire assignment step-by-step in simple, beginner-friendly language, starting with the core concepts.

🔹 What is Statistics?
Statistics is a branch of math that helps us:

Collect data

Understand data

Summarize it using numbers

Make decisions or predictions based on that data

There are two main types of statistics:

Descriptive Statistics – Just shows what the data looks like (e.g., average marks of a class).

Inferential Statistics – Tries to make predictions or generalizations (e.g., based on a sample, predict marks of the whole college).

🔹 Descriptive Statistics: The Focus of Your Assignment
Descriptive Statistics helps us understand data by summarizing it with numbers like:

Mean (average)

Median (middle value)

Mode (most frequent value)

Range

Standard Deviation (how spread out the values are)

Percentiles, Quartiles

Skewness (is data tilted more to one side?)

🔹 1. Measures of Central Tendency
These help us understand the center of the data.

Measure	Meaning	Example
Mean	The average	Add all values and divide by count
Median	Middle value	Sort the data, take center
Mode	Most frequent value	Value that occurs most often
Example:
Let’s say your marks are:

[17, 16, 21, 18, 15, 17, 21, 19, 11, 23]
Mean = (Sum of all numbers) ÷ (Count) = 178 / 10 = 17.8

Median = middle of sorted list → [11, 15, 16, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 23] → (17 + 18)/2 = 17.5

Mode = value occurring most = 17 and 21 → bimodal

🔹 2. Measures of Dispersion (Variability)
These show how spread out the data is.

Measure	Meaning
Range	Max - Min
Variance	Average squared difference from mean
Standard Deviation	Square root of variance
Mean Absolute Deviation	Average distance from mean (without squaring)
Quartiles	Values dividing data into 4 parts
Skewness	Tells if data is tilted to left or right
🔹 3. Types of Variables
Variables = Things we measure (like age, gender, income, etc.)

✅ Two Main Types:
Categorical (Qualitative):

Can't do math with it

Examples: Gender, Country, Grade (A, B, C)

Numerical (Quantitative):

Can do math

Examples: Age, Height, Income

Categorical Subtypes:
Nominal – No natural order (e.g., Gender, City)

Ordinal – Has order (e.g., Excellent > Good > Average)

Numerical Subtypes:
Discrete – Countable (e.g., No. of children)

Continuous – Measurable (e.g., Height, Income)

🔹 4. Grouped Summary Statistics (Core of Assignment)
When we group data (like group ages by gender or income by job type), we get group-wise summaries.

For example:

df.groupby('Gender')['Income'].mean()
This will give you the average income for each gender group.

You can also get:

.min() → lowest value in group

.max() → highest value

.std() → standard deviation

.median() → middle value

.describe() → all basic stats at once

🔹 5. Using Python (Pandas)
Here are quick Python snippets to get these values:

Task	Code
Mean of column	df['Age'].mean()
Median	df['Age'].median()
Mode	df['Age'].mode()
Min & Max	df['Age'].min() , df['Age'].max()
Std Dev	df['Age'].std()
Grouped Mean	df.groupby('Gender')['Income'].mean()
Full stats	df.describe()
✅ Assignment Tasks Summary:
Use any dataset like academic performance.csv or iris.csv.

Calculate mean, median, min, max, std dev for numeric columns.

Group data by a categorical column and find these stats for each group.

For Iris dataset – filter by each species and show stats like percentiles, mean, std.

1. Linear Regression: It is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It
 targets prediction values on the basis of independent variables.
 ● It is preferred to find out the relationship between forecasting and variables.
 ● A linear relationship between a dependent variable (X) is continuous; while
 independent variable(Y) relationship may be continuous or discrete. A linear
 relationship should be available in between predictor and target variable so known
 as Linear Regression.
 ● Linear regression is popular because the cost function is Mean Squared Error
 (MSE) which is equal to the average squared difference between an observation’s
 actual and predicted values.
 ● It is shown as an equation of line like :
 Y = m*X + b + e
 Where : b is intercepted, m is slope of the line and e is error term.
 This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable Y based on given
 predictor variable(s) X, as shown in Fig. 1.

 ● Fig. 2 shown below is about the relation between weight (in Kg) and height (in
 cm), a linear relation. It is an approach of studying in a statistical manner to
 summarise and learn the relationships among continuous (quantitative) variables.
 ● Here a variable, denoted by ‘x’ is considered as the predictor, explanatory, or
 independent variable.

Subject : DSBDAL
 ● Another variable, denoted ‘y’, is considered as the response, outcome, or
 dependent variable. While "predictor" and "response" used to refer to these
 variables.
 ● Simple linear regression technique concerned with the study of only one predictor
 variable.
 Fig.2 : Relation between weight (in Kg) and height (in cm)
 MultiVariate Regression :It concerns the study of two or more predictor variables.
 Usually a transformation of the original features into polynomial features from a given
 degree is preferred and further Linear Regression is applied on it.
 ● Asimple linear model Y = a + bX is in original feature will be transformed into
 polynomial feature is transformed and further a linear regression applied to it and
 it will be something like
 Y=a + bX + cX2
 ● If ahigh degree value is used in transformation the curve becomes over-fitted as it
 captures the noise from data as well.
 2. Least Square Method for Linear Regression
 ● Linear Regression involves establishing linear relationships between dependent and
 independent variables. Such a relationship is portrayed in the form of an equation also
 known as the linear model.
 Dr. D Y Patil School of Engineering,Lohgaon
Department of Computer Engineering

 ● Asimplelinear model is the one which involves only one dependent and one independent
 variable. Regression Models are usually denoted in Matrix Notations.
 ● However, for a simple univariate linear model, it can be denoted by the regression

 β 0
 β 1
 is the value of y when x=0 or the y intercept

 is the value of slope of the line ε is the error or the noise
 ● This linear equation represents a line also known as the ‘regression line’. The least square
 estimation technique is one of the basic techniques used to guess the values of the
 parameters and based on a sample set.
 ● Thistechnique estimates parameters
 β 0
 and
 β 1
 and by trying to minimise the square
 of errors at all the points in the sample set. The error is the deviation of the actual sample

 Once the Linear Model is estimated using equations (3) and (4), we can estimate the
 value of the dependent variable in the given range only. Going outside the range is called
 extrapolation which is inaccurate if simple regression techniques are used.
 3. Measuring Performance of Linear Regression
 Mean Square Error:
 The Mean squared error (MSE) represents the error of the estimator or predictive model
 created based on the given set of observations in the sample. Two or more regression
 models created using a given sample data can be compared based on their MSE. The
 lesser the MSE, the better the regression model is. When the linear regression model is
 trained using a given set of observations, the model with the least mean sum of squares
 error (MSE) is selected as the best model. The Python or R packages select the best-fit
 model as the model with the lowest MSE or lowest RMSE when training the linear
 regression models.
 Mathematically, the MSE can be calculated as the average sum of the squared difference
 between the actual value and the predicted or estimated value represented by the
 regression model (line or plane).
 Dr. D Y Patil School of Engineering,Lohgaon
Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 An MSE of zero (0) represents the fact that the predictor is a perfect predictor.
 RMSE:
 Root Mean Squared Error method that basically calculates the least-squares error and takes a
 root of the summed values.
 Mathematically speaking, Root Mean Squared Error is the square root of the sum of all errors
 divided by the total number of values. This is the formula to calculate RMSE
 RMSE - Least Squares Regression Method - Edureka
 R-Squared :
 R-Squared is the ratio of the sum of squares regression (SSR) and the sum of squares total
 (SST).
 SST : total sum of squares (SST), regression sum of squares (SSR), Sum of square of errors
 (SSE) are all showing the variation with different measures.
 Dr. D Y Patil School of Engineering,Lohgaon
Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 A value of R-squared closer to 1 would mean that the regression model covers most part
 of the variance of the values of the response variable and can be termed as a good
 model.
 One can alternatively use MSE or R-Squared based on what is appropriate and the need of the
 hour. However, the disadvantage of using MSE rather than R-squared is that it will be difficult
 to gauge the performance of the model using MSE as the value of MSE can vary from 0 to
 any larger number. However, in the case of R-squared, the value is bounded between 0 and .

 5. Training data set and Testing data set
 ● Machine Learning algorithm has two phases
 1.
 Training   and   2.   Testing.
 ● Theinput of the training phase is training data, which is passed to any machine learning
 algorithm and machine learning model is generated as output of the training phase.
 ● Theinput of the testing phase is test data, which is passed to the machine learning model
 and prediction is done to observe the correctness of mode.
 Fig. 1.3.1 : Training and Testing Phase in Machine Learning
 (a) Training Phase
 ● Training dataset is provided as input to this phase.
 ● Training dataset is a dataset having attributes and class labels and used for training
 Machine Learning algorithms to prepare models.

 ● Machines can learn when they observe enough relevant data. Using this one can model
 algorithms to find relationships, detect patterns, understand complex problems and make
 decisions.
 ● Training error is the error that occurs by applying the model to the same data from which
 the model is trained.
 ● Inasimple way the actual output of training data and predicted output of the model does
 not match the training error Ein
 is said to have occurred.
 ● Training error is much easier to compute.
 (b) Testing Phase
 ● Testing dataset is provided as input to this phase.
 ● Test dataset is a dataset for which class label is unknown. It is tested using model
 ● A test dataset used for assessment of the finally chosen model.
 ● Training and Testing dataset are completely different.
 ● Testing error is the error that occurs by assessing the model by providing the unknown
 data to the model.
 ● Inasimple way the actual output of testing data and predicted output of the model does
 not match the testing error Eout
 is said to have occurred.
 ● Eout
 is generally observed larger than Ein
 .
 (c) Generalization
 ● Generalization is the prediction of the future based on the past system.
 ● It needs to generalize beyond the training data to some future data that it might not have
 seen yet.
 ● The ultimate aim of the machine learning model is to minimize the generalization error.
 ● The generalization error is essentially the average error for data the model has never
 seen.
 ● In general, the dataset is divided into two partition training and test sets.
 ● The fit method is called on the training set to build the model.
 ● This fit method is applied to the model on the test set to estimate the target value and
 evaluate the model's performance.
 ● Thereason the data is divided into training and test sets is to use the test set to estimate
 how well the model trained on the training data and how well it would perform on the
 unseen data.

Subject: DSBDAL

Title of the Assignment
Create a Linear Regression Model using Python to Predict Home Prices using the Boston Housing Dataset
Dataset: Kaggle - Boston Housing

Objective of the Assignment
To perform data analysis using linear regression in Python on the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices.

Prerequisites
Basics of Python programming

Concept of Regression

Theory
1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).

Simple Linear Regression uses one feature variable.

Multivariate Linear Regression uses multiple feature variables.

The regression line is given by:
Y = mX + b + e
where m is the slope, b is the intercept, and e is the error term.

2. Least Squares Method
It aims to minimize the sum of squared errors between actual and predicted values.
The slope and intercept can be computed as:

3. Model Performance Evaluation
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower is better.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
Square root of MSE; retains unit scale of target variable.

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Indicates how well the model explains the variability in the target. Closer to 1 is better.

4. Example
Using 5 student scores:

Student	X (Std X)	Y (Std XII)
1	95	85
2	85	95
3	80	70
4	70	65
5	60	70
Using polyfit, the equation is:
Y = 0.644 * X + 26.76

If X = 65, then Y ≈ 68.63

5. Training and Testing Dataset
Training Set: Used to build the model

Testing Set: Used to evaluate performance

1. Logistic Regression: Classification techniques are an essential part of machine learning
 and data mining applications. Approximately 70% of problems in Data Science are
 classification problems. There are lots of classification problems that are available, but
 logistic regression is common and is a useful regression method for solving the binary
 classification problem. Another category of classification is Multinomial classification,
 which handles the issues where multiple classes are present in the target variable. For
 example, the IRIS dataset is a very famous example of multi-class classification. Other
 examples are classifying article/blog/document categories.
 Logistic Regression can be used for various classification problems such as spam
 detection. Diabetes prediction, if a given customer will purchase a particular product or
 will they churn another competitor, whether the user will click on a given advertisement
 link or not, and many more examples are in the bucket.
 Logistic Regression is one of the most simple and commonly used Machine Learning
 algorithms for two-class classification. It is easy to implement and can be used as the
 baseline for any binary classification problem. Its basic fundamental concepts are also
 constructive in deep learning. Logistic regression describes and estimates the relationship
 between one dependent binary variable and independent variables.
 Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or
 target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible
 classes. For example, it can be used for cancer detection problems. It computes the
 probability of an event occurring.

Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 It is a special case of linear regression where the target variable is categorical in nature. It
 uses a log of odds as the dependent variable. Logistic Regression predicts the probability
 of occurrence of a binary event utilising a logit function.
 Linear Regression Equation:
 Where, y is a dependent variable and x1, x2 ... and Xn are explanatory variables.
 Sigmoid Function:
 Apply Sigmoid function on linear regression:
 2. Differentiate between Linear and Logistic Regression
 Linear regression gives you a continuous output, but logistic regression provides a constant
 output. An example of the continuous output is house price and stock price. Example's of the
 discrete output is predicting whether a patient has cancer or not, predicting whether the customer
 will churn. Linear regression is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) while logistic
 regression is estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach.

Subject : DSBDAL
 3. Sigmoid Function
 The sigmoid function, also called logistic function, gives an ‘S’ shaped curve that can take any
 real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1. If the curve goes to positive infinity,
 y predicted will become 1, and if the curve goes to negative infinity, y predicted will become 0.
 If the output of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5, we can classify the outcome as 1 or YES,
 and if it is less than 0.5, we can classify it as 0 or NO. The outputcannotFor example: If the
 output is 0.75, we can say in terms of probability as: There is a 75 percent chance that a patient
 will suffer from cancer.
 4. Types of LogisticRegression
 Binary Logistic Regression: The target variable has only two possible outcomes such as
 Spam or Not Spam, Cancer or No Cancer.
 Multinomial Logistic Regression: The target variable has three or more nominal
 categories such as predicting the type of Wine.
 Ordinal Logistic Regression: the target variable has three or more ordinal categories
 such as restaurant or product rating from 1 to 5.

Subject : DSBDAL
 5. Confusion Matrix Evaluation Metrics
 Contingency table or Confusion matrix is often used to measure the performance of classifiers. A
 confusion matrix contains information about actual and predicted classifications done by a
 classification system. Performance of such systems is commonly evaluated using the data in the
 matrix.
 The following table shows the confusion matrix for a two class classifier.
 Here each row indicates the actual classes recorded in the test data set and the each column indicates the
 classes as predicted by the classifier.
 Numbers on the descending diagonal indicate correct predictions, while the ascending diagonal concerns
 prediction errors.
 Some Important measures derived from confusion matrix are:
 ● Number of positive (Pos) : Total number instances which are labelled as positive in a given
 dataset.
 ● Number of negative (Neg) : Total number instances which are labelled as negative in a given
 dataset.
 ● Number of True Positive (TP) : Number of instances which are actually labelled as positive
 and the predicted class by classifier is also positive.
 ● Number of True Negative (TN) : Number of instances which are actually labelled as negative
 and the predicted class by classifier is also negative.
 ● Number of False Positive (FP) : Number of instances which are actually labelled as negative
 and the predicted class by classifier is  positive.
 ● Number of False Negative (FN): Number of instances which are actually labelled as positive
 and the class predicted by the classifier is negative.

Certainly! Let's walk through the concepts and practical workflow presented in your assignment step by step—from basic theory to logistic regression implementation and evaluation using a confusion matrix.

🔍 Part 1: Core Concepts
✅ 1. Logistic Regression (What & Why)
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm, despite the name.

It is used to predict binary outcomes: Yes/No, 1/0, True/False (e.g., Will a user click the ad?).

It calculates the probability of a class using a logistic (sigmoid) function.

📌 Use cases: spam detection, churn prediction, cancer detection, click prediction, etc.

📊 5. Confusion Matrix & Evaluation Metrics
Used to evaluate classification performance:

Predicted Positive	Predicted Negative
Actual Positive	True Positive (TP)	False Negative (FN)
Actual Negative	False Positive (FP)	True Negative (TN)

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's break down the confusion matrix step by step using simple terms and real-life analogy so you understand what each part means.

📊 Confusion Matrix Explained
The confusion matrix is a 2x2 table used for binary classification problems (i.e., two possible outcomes like "Yes" or "No", "Spam" or "Not Spam", etc.).

🧠 Imagine This:
You're building a model to predict whether a person will buy a product online.

So, each person either:

Actually buys (Actual Positive)

Does not buy (Actual Negative)

And your model predicts either:

Will buy (Predicted Positive)

Will not buy (Predicted Negative)

🧮 Now, We Create a Confusion Matrix:
Predicted: Yes	Predicted: No
Actual: Yes (Buys)	✅ TP	❌ FN
Actual: No (Doesn't Buy)	❌ FP	✅ TN
🔍 What Each Cell Means
Term	Full Form	Meaning
TP	True Positive	Model predicted "Buy", and the person actually bought it. ✅ Correct.
TN	True Negative	Model predicted "Not Buy", and the person didn’t buy. ✅ Correct.
FP	False Positive	Model predicted "Buy", but the person didn’t buy. ❌ Wrong.
FN	False Negative	Model predicted "Not Buy", but the person actually bought. ❌ Wrong.
🔧 Why is it Important?
Each of these values tells us different types of model performance:

TP + TN = Correct Predictions

FP + FN = Mistakes

These are used to calculate performance metrics like:

Accuracy: How many total predictions were correct?

Precision: Of those we predicted as "Yes", how many were actually "Yes"?

Recall (Sensitivity): Of all the actual "Yes" cases, how many did we catch?

Error Rate: Total incorrect predictions / total predictions.

📦 Example:
Say your model analyzed 100 people:

Predicted Yes	Predicted No
Actual Yes (Buys)	40 (TP)	10 (FN)
Actual No (Doesn’t Buy)	5 (FP)	45 (TN)
From this:

TP = 40

FN = 10

FP = 5

TN = 45

Then:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (40 + 45) / 100 = 0.85 or 85%

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 40 / (40 + 5) = 0.89 or 89%

Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 40 / (40 + 10) = 0.80 or 80%

 ● Naïve Bayes Classifier can be used for Classification of categorical data.
 ○ Let there be a ‘j’ number of classes. C={1,2,….j}
 ○ Let, input observation is specified by ‘P’ features. Therefore input observation x
 is given ,  x = {F1,F2,…..Fp}
 ○ The Naïve Bayes classifier depends on Bayes' rule from probability theory.
 ● Prior probabilities: Probabilities which are calculated for some event based on no other
 information are called Prior probabilities.
 For example, P(A), P(B), P(C) are prior probabilities because while calculating P(A),
 occurrences of event B or C are not concerned i.e. no information about occurrence of
 any other event is used.
 Conditional Probabilities:
 From equation (1) and (2) ,
 Is called the Bayes Rule.

 2. Example of Naive Bayes
 We have a dataset with some features Outlook, Temp, Humidity, and Windy, and the
 target here is to predict whether a person or team will play tennis or not.
 Conditional Probability
 Here, we are predicting the probability of class1 and class2 based on the given condition. If I try
 to write the same formula in terms of classes and features, we will get the following equation
 Now we have two classes and four features, so if we write this formula for class C1, it will be
 something
 like
 this.
 Here, we replaced Ck with C1 and X with the intersection of X1, X2, X3, X4. You might have a
 question, It’s because we are taking the situation when all these features are present at the same
 time.

Subject : DSBDAL
 The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that all the features are independent of each other or in other
 words all the features are unrelated. With that assumption, we can further simplify the above
 formula and write it in this form
 This is the final equation of the Naive Bayes and we have to calculate the probability of both C1
 and C2.For this particular example.
 P (N0 | Today) > P (Yes | Today) So, the prediction that golf would be played is ‘No’.

ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Let’s break down and explain the basic concepts involved in the assignment related to the Naïve Bayes classifier, using the Iris dataset as an example.

🧠 1. What is Naïve Bayes?
Naïve Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption that features are independent of each other (that's why it's called "naïve").

📘 Bayes' Theorem
Bayes’ Theorem helps calculate the probability of a class (C) given some evidence/features (X).

P
(
C
∣
X
)
=
P
(
X
∣
C
)
⋅
P
(
C
)
P
(
X
)
P(C∣X)= 
P(X)
P(X∣C)⋅P(C)
​
 
Where:

P
(
C
∣
X
)
P(C∣X): Posterior probability of class C given predictor X

P
(
X
∣
C
)
P(X∣C): Likelihood – probability of predictor X given class C

P
(
C
)
P(C): Prior probability of class C

P
(
X
)
P(X): Evidence probability of predictor X

🧩 What Makes It “Naïve”?
The model assumes that all features are independent. That means:

P
(
X
∣
C
)
=
P
(
F

∣
C
)
⋅
P

P

)
P(X∣C)=P(F 
1
​
 ∣C)⋅P(F 
2
​
 ∣C)⋅...⋅P(F 
n
​
 ∣C)
Even though this is rarely true in real-world data, the assumption simplifies computation and works surprisingly well in practice.

🟨 2. Example: Play Tennis?
Say we have a dataset with features:

Outlook: Sunny, Rainy

Temperature: Hot, Mild

Humidity: High, Normal

Windy: True, False

Target variable: Play Tennis? (Yes/No)

We use probabilities to decide whether to play tennis based on today’s weather. The algorithm calculates:

P
(
Y
e
s
∣
T
o
d
a
y
)
v
s
P
(
N
o
∣
T
o
d
a
y
)
P(Yes∣Today)vsP(No∣Today)
Whichever is higher, becomes our prediction.

📊 3. Confusion Matrix and Metrics
A Confusion Matrix compares predicted vs actual values:

Predicted: Yes	Predicted: No
Actual: Yes	TP (True Pos.)	FN (False Neg.)
Actual: No	FP (False Pos.)	TN (True Neg.)
From this matrix, we calculate:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total

Error Rate = 1 - Accuracy

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Y (label): iris species

✅ Step 4: Split Data

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, ...)
✅ Step 5: Train the Model
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
✅ Step 6: Make Predictions

 Basic concepts of Text Analytics
 One of the most frequent types of day-to-day conversion is text communication. In our
 everyday routine, we chat, message, tweet, share status, email, create blogs, and offer
 opinions and criticism. All of these actions lead to a substantial amount of unstructured
 text being produced. It is critical to examine huge amounts of data in this sector of the
 online world and social media to determine people's opinions.
 Text mining is also referred to as text analytics. Text mining is a process of exploring
 sizable textual data and finding patterns. Text Mining processes the text itself, while NLP
 processes with the underlying metadata. Finding frequency counts of words, length of the
 sentence, presence/absence of specific words is known as text mining. Natural language
 processing is one of the components of text mining. NLP helps identify sentiment,
 finding entities in the sentence, and category of blog/article. Text mining is preprocessed
 data for text analytics. In Text Analytics, statistical and machine learning algorithms are
 used to classify information.
 Text Analysis Operations using natural language toolkit
 NLTK(natural language toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to
 work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces and lexical resources
 such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification,
 tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning and many more.
 Analysing movie reviews is one of the classic examples to demonstrate a simple NLP
 Bag-of-words model, on movie reviews.
 2.1.
 Tokenization:
 Tokenization is the first step in text analytics. The process of breaking down a text
 paragraph into smaller chunks such as words or sentences is called Tokenization.
 Token is a single entity that is the building blocks for a sentence or paragraph.
 ● Sentence tokenization : split a paragraph into list of sentences using
 sent_tokenize() method
 Dr D Y Patil School of Engineering
Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 ● Word tokenization : split a sentence into list of words using word_tokenize()
 method
 2.2.
 2.3.
 Stop words removal
 Stopwords considered as noise in the text. Text may contain stop words such as is,
 am, are, this, a, an, the, etc. In NLTK for removing stopwords, you need to create
 a list of stopwords and filter out your list of tokens from these words.
 Stemming and Lemmatization
 Stemming is a normalization technique where lists of tokenized words are
 converted into shortened root words to remove redundancy. Stemming is the
 process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem,
 base or root form.
 A computer program that stems word may be called a stemmer.
 E.g.
 A stemmer reduces the words like fishing, fished, and fisher to the stem fish.
 The stem need not be a word, for example the Porter algorithm reduces, argue,
 argued, argues, arguing, and argus to the stem argu .
 Lemmatization in NLTK is the algorithmic process of finding the lemma of a
 word depending on its meaning and context. Lemmatization usually refers to the
 morphological analysis of words, which aims to remove inflectional endings. It
 helps in returning the base or dictionary form of a word known as the lemma.

 Lemmatization Vs Stemming
 Stemming algorithm works by cutting the suffix from the word. In a broader sense
 cuts either the beginning or end of the word.
 On the contrary, Lemmatization is a more powerful operation, and it takes into
 consideration morphological analysis of the words. It returns the lemma which is
 the base form of all its inflectional forms. In-depth linguistic knowledge is

 required to create dictionaries and look for the proper form of the word.
 Stemming is a general operation while lemmatization is an intelligent operation
 where the proper form will be looked in the dictionary. Hence, lemmatization
 helps in forming better machine learning features.

 POS Tagging
 POS (Parts of Speech) tell us about grammatical information of words of the
 sentence by assigning specific token (Determiner, noun, adjective , adverb ,
 verb,Personal Pronoun etc.) as tag (DT,NN ,JJ,RB,VB,PRP etc) to each words.
 Word can have more than one POS depending upon the context where it is used.
 We can use POS tags as statistical NLP tasks. It distinguishes a sense of word
 which is very helpful in text realization and infer semantic information from text
 for sentiment analysis.
 Text Analysis Model using TF-IDF.
 Term frequency–inverse document frequency(TFIDF) , is a numerical statistic
 that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or
 corpus.
 ● Term Frequency (TF)
 It is a measure of the frequency of a word (w) in a document (d). TF is defined as
 the ratio of a word’s occurrence in a document to the total number of words in a
 document. The denominator term in the formula is to normalize since all the
 corpus documents are of different lengths.
 Example:
 Dr D Y Patil School of Engineering
Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 The initial step is to make a vocabulary of unique words and calculate TF for each
 document. TF will be more for words that frequently appear in a document and
 less for rare words in a document.
 ● Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
 It is the measure of the importance of a word. Term frequency (TF) does not
 consider the importance of words. Some words such as’ of’, ‘and’, etc. can be
 most frequently present but are of little significance. IDF provides weightage to
 each word based on its frequency in the corpus D.
 In our example, since we have two documents in the corpus, N=2.
 Dr D Y Patil School of Engineering
Department of Computer Engineering                                                                          
Subject : DSBDAL
 ● Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)
 It is the product of TF and IDF.
 TFIDF gives more weightage to the word that is rare in the corpus (all the documents).
 TFIDF provides more importance to the word that is more frequent in the document.
 After applying TFIDF, text in A and B documents can be represented as a TFIDF vector of
 dimension equal to the vocabulary words. The value corresponding to each word represents
 the importance of that word in a particular document.
 TFIDF is the product of TF with IDF. Since TF values lie between 0 and 1, not using ln can
 result in high IDF for some words, thereby dominating the TFIDF. We don’t want that, and
 therefore, we use ln so that the IDF should not completely dominate the TFIDF.
 ● Disadvantage of TFIDF
 It is unable to capture the semantics. For example, funny and humorous are synonyms, but
 TFIDF does not capture that. Moreover, TFIDF can be computationally expensive if the
 vocabulary is vast.

 Bag of Words (BoW)
 Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly. Rather, the text must be
 converted into vectors of numbers. In natural language processing, a common technique
 for extracting features from text is to place all of the words that occur in the text in a

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a precise and well-structured explanation of all the key concepts and steps involved in this text analytics practical on Text Preprocessing and TF-IDF, based on your assignment:

🎯 Assignment Title
Apply preprocessing methods:
Tokenization, POS Tagging, Stop Words Removal, Stemming, Lemmatization

Represent the document using Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

🧠 Objective
Students should learn how to perform Text Analysis using the TF-IDF algorithm, a foundational technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

📚 Prerequisites
Basics of Python

Basic understanding of the English language

📝 Theory Summary
🔹 1. Basic Concepts of Text Analytics
Everyday digital activity (chat, blogs, tweets) generates huge unstructured text data.

Text Mining finds patterns in this data using techniques like frequency counts, keyword detection.

Text Analytics applies statistical and machine learning models to this data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a core part of text mining, which deals with understanding and processing human language.

🔹 2. Text Analysis Operations using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
2.1. Tokenization
Splits text into:

Sentences: sent_tokenize()

Words: word_tokenize()

These are the building blocks for any NLP task.

2.2. Stop Words Removal
Words like “is”, “am”, “the” carry little meaning.

stopwords.words("english") is used to filter them out.

2.3. Stemming
Converts words to their base form by removing suffixes.

Uses PorterStemmer() (e.g., “waiting” → “wait”).

Fast but sometimes inaccurate.

2.4. Lemmatization
More accurate than stemming.

Converts word to its dictionary form using context.

Uses WordNetLemmatizer() (e.g., “studies” → “study”).

2.5. POS Tagging (Parts of Speech)
Tags each word with its grammatical role like noun (NN), verb (VB), adjective (JJ), etc.

Helps in understanding context and is essential for tasks like lemmatization and sentiment analysis.

Example: nltk.pos_tag() on tokenized words.

🔹 3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)
➤ Term Frequency (TF)
How often a word appears in a document.

Formula:

T
F
(
w
)
=
No. of times w appears
Total words in document
TF(w)= 
Total words in document
No. of times w appears
​
 
➤ Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
Measures how rare a word is across all documents.

Formula:

I
D
F
(
w
)
=
log
⁡
(
Total no. of documents
No. of documents with word w
)
IDF(w)=log( 
No. of documents with word w
Total no. of documents
​
 )
➤ TF-IDF
Combines both:

TF-IDF
(
w
)
=
T
F
(
w
)
×
I
D
F
(
w
)
TF-IDF(w)=TF(w)×IDF(w)
Gives high weight to rare, meaningful words.

🔹 4. Bag of Words (BoW)
Converts text into vectors of word counts.

Each word in the vocabulary becomes a feature.

Does not preserve word order, only frequency.

explain code
ChatGPT said:
This Python code demonstrates Text Preprocessing and TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Let’s go step-by-step through the code:

✅ 1. Importing Required Libraries & Downloading NLTK Resources
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('stopwords')
These lines ensure that all necessary datasets and models are available for:

punkt: For tokenizing sentences and words.

averaged_perceptron_tagger: For Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.

wordnet: For lemmatization (WordNet is a lexical database).

stopwords: Contains common stopwords like “is”, “the”, etc.

✅ 2. Importing Specific Functions from NLTK
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.probability import FreqDist
from nltk.corpus import wordnet
import math
These imports allow you to:

Tokenize text into words

Remove stopwords

Apply stemming and lemmatization

Compute term frequency

Use math functions (like log) for IDF

✅ 3. Sample Document
sample_document = "Text analytics is the process of analyzing unstructured text data to extract ... "
This is the sample text used for demonstrating preprocessing.

✅ 4. Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(sample_document)
Breaks the document into individual tokens (words and punctuation).

✅ 5. POS Tagging
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
Assigns Parts of Speech tags to each token (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). This is helpful for lemmatization.

✅ 6. Stop Words Removal
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
Removes common words like "is", "the", "to" which don’t add much meaning to the document.

✅ 7. Stemming
ps = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [ps.stem(word) for word in filtered_tokens]
Reduces words to their root form:

"analyzing", "analysis", "analyzed" → "analyz"

This is done by chopping suffixes.

✅ 8. Lemmatization
wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_tokens = [wnl.lemmatize(word, pos='v') for word in filtered_tokens]
Returns the base or dictionary form of words:

"studies", "studying" → "study"

Lemmatization uses grammar and context, unlike stemming.

✅ 9. Term Frequency (TF)
tf = FreqDist(lemmatized_tokens)
Calculates how frequently each word appears in the lemmatized list (bag-of-words style).

✅ 10. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
def idf(term, documents):
    doc_with_term = sum(1 for doc in documents if term in doc)
    if doc_with_term == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return math.log(len(documents) / doc_with_term)
Measures how rare or unique a term is across all documents:

Common words across all documents have low IDF

Rare or unique terms have high IDF

✅ 11. Collection of Documents
documents = [
    "Text analytics is the process ...",
    "Text analytics involves several preprocessing steps ...",
    "Text analytics helps in extracting insights ..."
]
Used to calculate IDF scores for each term.

✅ 12. Calculate IDF for Each Word
for doc in documents:
    doc_tokens = word_tokenize(doc)
    doc_tokens = [wnl.lemmatize(word.lower(), pos='v') for word in doc_tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
    for term in set(doc_tokens):
        idf_scores[term] = idf(term, documents)
Tokenizes each document

Removes stopwords and lemmatizes

Computes IDF for each unique term

✅ 13. Printing Results
print("Tokenization:", tokens)
print("\nPOS Tagging:", pos_tags)
...
Outputs each stage of processing to help you observe the transformation of the raw document into useful features.

📌 Summary:
Step	Purpose
Tokenization	Split text into words
POS Tagging	Tag words with grammar info
Stopword Removal	Remove common, non-informative words
Stemming	Reduce words to base/root form
Lemmatization	More accurate base form using grammar
TF Calculation	Word frequency within a document
IDF Calculation	Importance of a word across multiple documents

Title: Data Visualization I 
1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains information 
about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic ship. Use the Seaborn library 
to see if we can find any patterns in the data. 
2. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column name: 'fare') for each 
passenger is distributed by plotting a histogram. 
Theory: -  
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements 
like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and 
understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools 
and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven 
decisions 
The advantages and benefits of good data visualization: 
Data visualization is another form of visual art that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes 
on the message. When we see a chart, we quickly see trends and outliers. If we can see something, 
we internalize it quickly.  
Patterns of data can be find out with the help of different types of plots 
Types of plots are: 
A. Distribution Plots 
a. Dist-Plot 
b. Joint Plot 
d. Rug Plot 
B. Categorical Plots 
a. Bar Plot 
b. Count Plot 
c. Box Plot 
d. Violin Plot 
C. Advanced Plots 
a. Strip Plot 
b. Swarm Plot 
D. Matrix Plots 
a. Heat Map 
b. Cluster Map 
A. Distribution Plots: 
These plots help us to visualize the distribution of data. We can use these plots to 
understand the mean, median, range, variance, deviation, etc of the data. 
a. Distplot 
● Dist plot gives us the histogram of the selected continuous variable. 
● It is an example of a univariate analysis. 
● We can change the number of bins i.e. number of vertical bars in a histogram 
b. Joint Plot 
● It is the combination of the distplot of two variables. 
● It is an example of bivariate analysis. 
● We additionally obtain a scatter plot between the variables to reflect their linear 
relationship. We can customise the scatter plot into a hexagonal plot, where, the 
more the colour intensity, the more will be the number of observations. 
c. The Rug Plot 
The rugplot() is used to draw small bars along the x-axis for each point in the 
dataset. To plot a rug plot, you need to pass the name of the column. Let's plot a 
rug plot for fare. 
Algorithm: 
Step 1: Download the data set of Titanic (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)  
Step 2: Importing Libraries  
import pandas as pd  
import numpy as np   
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns   
dataset = sns.load_dataset('titanic')   
dataset.head()   
Step 3: Draw distributional plot  
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'])  
Step 4: Removal of Kernal Density line  
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'], kde=False)  
Step 5: Draw histogram  
sns.histplot(data=dataset, x="fare",binwidth=30) 
Step 6: The Joint Plot 
sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset)  
Step 7: The Pair Plot

ChatGPT said:
This practical focuses on Data Visualization using Seaborn with the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and insights from the data. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and steps involved:

🔹 1. Dataset: Titanic
A famous dataset with details of 891 passengers aboard the Titanic.

It includes features like:

fare (ticket price)

age

sex

survived

pclass (passenger class)

embarked (port of embarkation)

etc.

➤ Goal:
Visualize the data to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.

🔹 2. What is Data Visualization?
Graphical representation of data using charts, plots, and graphs.

It helps in:

Identifying trends, outliers, and patterns

Making data-driven decisions

Grasping complex data easily

🔹 3. Types of Seaborn Plots Covered
🅐 Distribution Plots (Show how a single variable is distributed)
a. Distplot
Combines a histogram and a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) curve.

Shows how a numerical variable (like fare) is spread out.

sns.distplot(dataset['fare'])            # With KDE
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'], kde=False) # Without KDE
b. Histogram (histplot)
Shows only the bars (like a bar chart for continuous data).

Example:

sns.histplot(data=dataset, x="fare", binwidth=30)
c. Jointplot
Combines a scatter plot + histograms for two variables (bivariate analysis).

Shows both individual distributions and the relationship between two variables:

sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset)
d. Rug Plot
Small vertical lines along x-axis showing individual data points.

Can be combined with distplot.

sns.rugplot(dataset['fare'])
🔹 4. Categorical and Other Plot Types (Mentioned, but not all implemented here)
These are used when working with categorical data (like sex, pclass, embarked, etc.):

Bar Plot: Comparison of values by category

Count Plot: Shows counts of observations per category

Box Plot, Violin Plot: Show distribution with respect to a category

Strip Plot, Swarm Plot: Useful for scatter-like plots with categorical x-axis

Heatmap: Correlation matrix visualized as a color-coded grid

🔹 5. Practical Code Summary
✅ Import Libraries and Dataset
import pandas as pd  
import numpy as np   
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns   

dataset = sns.load_dataset('titanic')   # Load dataset
dataset.head()                          # View first few rows
✅ Draw Distribution Plots
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'])                 # Histogram + KDE
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'], kde=False)      # Histogram only
sns.histplot(data=dataset, x="fare", binwidth=30) # Newer alternative
✅ Joint Plot (2-variable relationship)
sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset)
✅ Pair Plot (Visualize multiple features)
sns.pairplot(dataset)
✅ Conclusion
By using Seaborn and the Titanic dataset:

You’ve visualized how ticket prices are distributed

Explored age-fare relationships using joint plots

Understood how to implement basic distribution plots in Python

sns.distplot(data['Fare'],kde=False)
sns.histplot(data=data, x="Fare",binwidth=30)

#Joint Plot It is the combination of the distplot of two variables.It is an example of bivariate analysis.We additionally obtain a scatter plot between the variable to reflectingtheir linear relationship. We can customize the scatter plot into a hexagonal plot, where, more the color intensity, the more will be the number of Observation



sns.jointplot(x='Age', y='Fare', data=data)

sns.pairplot(data)

data.describe()

data.isnull().sum()

sns.distplot(data['Age'])


#Rug Plot It draws a dash mark instead of a uniform distribution as in distplot. It is an example of a univariate analysis.

sns.rugplot(data['Fare'])

sns.barplot(x='Sex',y='Age',data=data)

##Count Plot It counts the number of occurrences of categorical variables.It is an example of a univariate analysis.The count plot is similar to the bar plot, however itdisplays the count of the categories in a specific column. For instance, if we want to count the number of males and women passenger we can do so using count plot asfollows:

sns.countplot(x='Sex',data=data)

Great! You've used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore and visualize the Titanic dataset. Here's a step-by-step explanation of your code and the visualizations:

✅ 1. Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
pandas: for data loading and manipulation.

numpy: for numerical operations (though not used directly here).

matplotlib.pyplot: for plotting.

seaborn: a high-level data visualization library built on top of matplotlib.

✅ 2. Load Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\nayan\\Downloads\\Titanic-Dataset.csv")
data.head()
Loads the Titanic dataset from a local file.

data.head() shows the first 5 rows for preview.

✅ 3. Distribution Plots (Univariate Analysis)
a. Distplot (with and without KDE)
sns.distplot(data['Fare'])
sns.distplot(data['Fare'], kde=False)
First plot: Histogram + smooth KDE line (Kernel Density Estimate).

Second plot: Histogram only, no KDE line.

Helps you see how ticket fares are distributed among passengers.

b. Histplot (modern alternative to distplot)
sns.histplot(data=data, x="Fare", binwidth=30)
More control over histogram appearance.

binwidth=30: controls the width of each bar.

✅ 4. Joint Plot (Bivariate Analysis)
sns.jointplot(x='Age', y='Fare', data=data)
Combines:

Scatter plot of Age vs Fare

Histograms of each variable on their axes

Good for detecting relationships or correlations between two numerical variables.

✅ 5. Pair Plot
sns.pairplot(data)
Automatically plots pairwise relationships between all numerical columns.

Includes scatter plots and histograms.

Useful for overall EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

✅ 6. Summary Statistics
data.describe()
Shows count, mean, std, min, max, and quartiles for each numerical column.

✅ 7. Null Value Check
data.isnull().sum()
Returns the number of missing values (NaN) in each column.

Helps you decide whether you need to clean or impute data.

✅ 8. Age Distribution
sns.distplot(data['Age'])
Same as fare, but this time for passenger age.

✅ 9. Rug Plot
sns.rugplot(data['Fare'])
Small vertical bars below the axis show individual data points.

Helps you see data density and raw data distribution.

✅ 10. Bar Plot
sns.barplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=data)
Compares the average age between male and female passengers.

Bar height shows the mean of Age for each category in Sex.

✅ 11. Count Plot (Categorical Frequency)
sns.countplot(x='Sex', data=data)
Counts the number of male and female passengers.

Quick and clear way to see frequency of categories in a column.

This topic covers Data Visualization II, focusing on Box Plots using the Titanic dataset. Here's a complete explanation of the concepts, code, and observations involved:

📌 1. Objective
You aim to:

Visualize the distribution of passenger ages for each gender.

Analyze how survival status affects that distribution.

Use Box Plots to clearly see variations.

📊 Theory: Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)
A box plot is used to show the distribution of a numeric variable across categories.

🔹 Key Components of a Box Plot:
Box: Represents the interquartile range (IQR) from 25th to 75th percentile.

Line inside the box: Median (50th percentile).

Whiskers: Typically extend to 1.5×IQR above and below.

Dots outside whiskers: Outliers.

📊 Theory: Bar Plot
Although not directly asked in the task, bar plots:

Show mean values of a numeric variable grouped by categories.

Example: Average age by gender.

🧮 Algorithm Steps and Code Breakdown
✅ Step 1: Import Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
Imports tools for data manipulation and plotting.

✅ Step 2: Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv('titanic')
Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.

✅ Step 3: Clean Dataset
df_cleaned = df.drop(['pclass','embarked','deck','embark_town'], axis=1)
Drops unnecessary columns to simplify visualization.

Keeps important ones like sex, age, survived.

✅ Step 4: Plot Box Plots
🔹 Box Plot by Gender
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="sex", y="age", color="Purple")
Shows how age is distributed within each gender.

Helps find outliers, age range, and median age for males and females.

🔹 Box Plot by Gender and Survival Status
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="sex", y="age", hue="survived")
Adds a hue to split boxes by survival (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived).

Allows comparison of age distributions for survivors vs non-survivors within each gender.

🧐 Observations You Might Make
Based on the box plots:

✅ General Observations:
Median age might be lower for females.

Female survivors might cluster in a younger age group.

More outliers among male passengers (older males?).

✅ Survival-Based Observations:
Women survivors are often younger (due to "women and children first" policy).

Men who survived may also have been younger or part of crew.

✅ Conclusion
You successfully used box plots to:

Visualize age distribution.

Compare age patterns by gender and survival.

Infer meaningful survival patterns based on age and gender.

#It’s a plot between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.It plots as a scatter plot but supplementarily uses 
#categorical encodings of the categorical variable.Thes tripplot() function is used to plot the violin plot. Like the box plot, 
#the first parameter is the categorical column, the second parameter is the numeric column while the thirdparameter is the dataset.

sns.stripplot(y=df['Age'],x=df['Pclass'])
#It is the combination of a strip plot and a violinplot.

sns.swarmplot(y=df['Age'],x=df['Pclass'])

Your code uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for advanced data visualization on the Titanic dataset. Here's a full explanation of each section:

🔹 1. Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pandas: for data loading and manipulation.

numpy: for numerical operations (not used explicitly here).

seaborn: for statistical plotting.

matplotlib.pyplot: underlying plotting engine.

🔹 2. Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\nayan\\Downloads\\Titanic-Dataset.csv")
Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.

df is now a DataFrame with all passenger data.

🔹 3. View and Describe Data
df.head()
df.describe()
head(): shows the first 5 rows.

describe(): gives statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns like Age, Fare.

🔹 4. Drop Unwanted Columns
df_cleaned = df.drop(['Pclass','Embarked','Fare'], axis=1)
Removes less relevant columns for this specific visualization.

This step simplifies the data for focused plotting.

🔹 5. Box Plots
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="Sex", y="Age", color="Purple")
Shows age distribution for each gender.

Box shows median, IQR, and outliers.

Color is set to purple for styling.

sns.boxplot(data=df, x="Sex", y="Age", hue="Survived")
Adds hue="Survived" to split the box plots into two: one for survivors, one for non-survivors.

Helps analyze how survival correlates with gender and age.

🔹 6. Strip Plot
sns.stripplot(y=df['Age'], x=df['Pclass'])
Categorical vs continuous plot.

Each point represents one passenger's age, grouped by Pclass.

Useful to see distribution of ages per class (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd class).

🔹 7. Swarm Plot
sns.swarmplot(y=df['Age'], x=df['Pclass'])
Similar to stripplot, but adjusts points to avoid overlap, making it clearer when many points have similar values.

Combines advantages of strip plot and box plot (visual + density).

✅ Summary
You used:

Box plots for distribution by gender and survival.

Strip/Swarm plots for detailed, non-aggregated views of age distribution across passenger classes.
These plots help detect patterns and correlations between demographics and survival.

Title: Data Visualization III 
Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. 
(e.g., https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ).  
Scan the dataset and give the inference as: 
1. List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the dataset. 
2. Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions. 
3. Create a box plot for each feature in the dataset. 
4. Compare distributions and identify outliers. 
Theory: 
Features of a Dataset 
The features of a dataset may allude to the columns available in the dataset. The features of a 
dataset are the most critical aspect of the dataset, as based on the features of each available data 
point, will there be any possibility of deploying models to find the output to predict the features of 
any new data point that may be added to the dataset. 
Some possible features of a dataset are: 
Numerical Features: These may include numerical values such as height, weight, and so on. 
These may be continuous over an interval, or discrete variables. 
Categorical Features: These include multiple classes/ categories, such as gender, colour, and so 
on. 
Metadata: Includes a general description of a dataset. Generally in very large datasets, having an 
idea/ description of the dataset when it’s transferred to a new developer will save a lot of time and 
improve efficiency. 
Size of the Data: It refers to the number of entries and features it contains in the file containing 
the Dataset. 
Formatting of Data: The datasets available online are available in several formats. Some of them 
are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), CSV (Comma Separated Value), XML (eXtensible 
Markup Language), DataFrame, and Excel Files (xlsx or xlsm). For particularly large datasets, 
especially involving images for disease detection, while downloading the files from the internet, 
it comes in zip files which will be needed to extract in the system to individual components. 
Algorithm: 
Step 1: Download the data set of Iris 
Step 2: Importing Libraries    
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
import pandas as pd 
df1=pd.read_csv("Iris_data_sample.csv") 
df1.head() 
Step 3: Identify Features & data types  
df1.shape 
df1.info() 
df1["Species"].unique() 
df1.groupby("Species").size() 
corr=df1.corr() 
plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6)) 
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True) 
Step 4: Draw Box Plot  
def graph(y): 
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y=y, data=df1, color="purple") 
plt.figure(figsize=(20,20)) 
Step 5: Adding the subplot at the specified grid position 
plt.subplot(221) 
graph('SepalLengthCm') 
plt.subplot(222) 
graph('SepalWidthCm') 
plt.subplot(223) 
graph('PetalLengthCm') 
plt.show() 
Questions: Identify the outliers from the boxplot drawn for iris dataset. 
Conclusion: Implemented successfully data visualization on dataset features using Python on 
Iris dataset.

ChatGPT said:
This task introduces Data Visualization III using the Iris flower dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The goal is to understand the dataset's structure, visualize its distributions, and detect outliers. Below is a full explanation of the concepts, steps, and plots used in this process:

🔍 Objective
To analyze the Iris dataset through:

Feature identification and data types

Histogram and boxplot visualizations

Outlier detection

Species comparison through plots

🌸 About the Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset contains data on 3 species of iris flowers:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Each data entry has:

SepalLengthCm (numeric)

SepalWidthCm (numeric)

PetalLengthCm (numeric)

PetalWidthCm (numeric)

Species (categorical/nominal)

📘 Key Concepts
🔹 1. Features and Types
Features = Columns in the dataset:

Numerical (Continuous): SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm

Categorical/Nominal: Species

🔹 2. Data Inspection
df1.shape         # Rows and columns count
df1.info()        # Data types and null check
df1["Species"].unique()    # Distinct flower species
df1.groupby("Species").size()  # Count per species
🔹 3. Correlation Heatmap
corr = df1.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
Shows linear correlation between features (e.g., petal length and width are usually strongly correlated).

🔹 4. Box Plot
Box plots summarize:

Median

Interquartile range (IQR)

Outliers (points beyond whiskers)

def graph(y): 
    sns.boxplot(x="Species", y=y, data=df1, color="purple")
Used in subplots to compare features across species:

plt.subplot(221)  # top-left
graph('SepalLengthCm')

plt.subplot(222)  # top-right
graph('SepalWidthCm')

plt.subplot(223)  # bottom-left
graph('PetalLengthCm')
🔹 5. Histograms (not explicitly shown in this script but typically used)
Histograms show the distribution of each numeric feature.

🔎 Outlier Detection via Boxplot
Outliers are points outside the whiskers (typically beyond 1.5×IQR from Q1 or Q3).

From the Iris dataset:

SepalWidthCm often shows more spread, with possible outliers especially for Setosa.

PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm for Setosa are significantly smaller than for other species.

Versicolor and Virginica often overlap, but still show distinct patterns.

✅ Conclusion
The code and visualizations help:

Identify types of features (numerical, categorical)

Visualize feature distributions

Detect outliers using boxplots

Compare species based on their sepal/petal measurements

This code is a data visualization script using the Iris dataset. It focuses on visualizing the distribution and spread of the four numerical features in the dataset: sepal and petal length and width. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

🧩 Part 1: Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pandas: For data manipulation.

numpy: For numerical operations.

seaborn and matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.

📥 Part 2: Load Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\nayan\\Downloads\\Iris.csv")
Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame called data.

🔍 Part 3: Check Unique Species
np.unique(data['Species'])
Displays the unique flower species in the dataset: ['Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', 'Iris-virginica'].

📊 Part 4: Plot Histograms
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(16, 8))
Creates a 2×2 subplot grid (i.e., 4 plots), and sets the figure size.

axes[0,0].set_title("Distribution of First Column")
axes[0,0].hist(data["SepalLengthCm"]);
Plots a histogram of SepalLengthCm.

axes[0,1].set_title("Distribution of First Column")
axes[0,1].hist(data["SepalWidthCm"]);
Histogram for SepalWidthCm.

axes[1,0].set_title("Distribution of First Column")
axes[1,0].hist(data["PetalLengthCm"]);
Histogram for PetalLengthCm.

axes[1,1].set_title("Distribution of First Column")
axes[1,1].hist(data["PetalWidthCm"]);
Histogram for PetalWidthCm.

🔎 Note: The title “Distribution of First Column” is repeated; it should ideally reflect the actual feature name for clarity.

📦 Part 5: Boxplot
data_to_plot = [data["SepalLengthCm"], data["SepalWidthCm"], data["PetalLengthCm"], data["PetalWidthCm"]]
Creates a list of the 4 numerical columns for plotting.

sns.set_style("whitegrid")
Applies Seaborn's white grid style to all plots (makes background light and grid visible).

fig = plt.figure(1, figsize=(12, 8))              # Create new figure
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)                         # Create subplot (1 row, 1 column, 1st plot)
bp = ax.boxplot(data_to_plot)                     # Create the boxplot
Boxplot summarizes each feature’s distribution:

Median (middle line in the box)

IQR (Interquartile Range) (box edges)

Whiskers (spread)

Outliers (individual points outside whiskers)

✅ What You Learn From This Code
Histograms show the frequency distribution of numerical features.

Boxplots help identify the central tendency and outliers.

You get a visual summary of how each feature is distributed across the dataset.

Would you like the plots to be labeled better or saved to a file?
